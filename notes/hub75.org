#+TITLE: Hub75


* Planned new hub75 driver
Add a double buffering sheme, so that data for the next line is read from sram, while the last one is being shifted out.
Read data from sdram into buffers (do palette lookup & maybe gamma correction at the same time).
This is done with 6 memory units, each 512 elements deep and 32 bits wide. (*2, for double buffering).

Each one is either assigned to the r, g or b channel. A collection of 3 memory
units can supply 4 pipelines at once, so in total each pipeline handles one
output, with both the top & bottom half. This means, we can shift a bit out every two cycles, without delay.

In total, this means 12 of 56 sysMEM blocks
